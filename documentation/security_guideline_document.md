# LockerRoom Talk App: Security Guidelines

This document defines security best practices and requirements for the LockerRoom Talk UI-only mobile application. Although the backend is provided by Firebase services, the client-side must embed security by design to protect user data, maintain privacy, and ensure resilient operation.

## 1. Security Principles

*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security from planning through implementation and testing.
*   **Least Privilege:** Restrict all components and services to minimal required permissions.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Layer client-side checks with Firebase Security Rules and network controls.
*   **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Treat all user input as untrusted. Sanitize, validate, and encode before use.
*   **Fail Securely:** On errors, do not expose sensitive data; display generic messages.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Configure libraries, Expo, and environment variables with the most restrictive settings by default.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

*   **Firebase Authentication:**

    *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity).
    *   Use secure hashing and salting (handled by Firebase).
    *   Enable email verification and optional Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

*   **Session Management:**

    *   Rely on Firebase SDK for token refresh; restrict token lifetime where possible.
    *   Store tokens only in secure storage (`SecureStore` or encrypted async-storage) with `HttpOnly`/`Secure` when on web.
    *   Provide explicit logout to clear tokens.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

    *   Define user roles (e.g., user, moderator) in Firestore custom claims.
    *   Validate roles client-side before showing UI elements; enforce in Firebase Security Rules.

## 3. Input Handling & Processing

*   **Client-Side Validation:**

    *   Validate forms (sign-up, reviews, chat) against strict schemas (e.g., `zod`, TypeScript types).
    *   Sanitize text (remove or escape HTML tags) to prevent injection.

*   **Prevent Injection:**

    *   Never build Firestore queries via string concatenation. Use the Firebase query API.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

    *   If targeting web, apply context-aware encoding when rendering user content.
    *   Do not dangerously set inner HTML.

*   **CSRF Protection:**

    *   For web modules, rely on Firebase’s token-based auth (automatically mitigates CSRF).

*   **File Uploads:**

    *   Validate image MIME types and file sizes in the client before uploading to Firebase Storage.
    *   Generate randomized filenames, avoid user-provided paths.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

*   **Encryption In Transit:**

    *   Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all Firebase endpoints (default in SDK).

*   **Local Data Storage:**

    *   Store only non-sensitive cache locally.
    *   Use encrypted storage for any tokens or PII (`expo-secure-store` or Keychain/Keystore).

*   **No Hardcoded Secrets:**

    *   Do not embed API keys or secrets in source. Use Expo’s secure environment variables or secret management.

*   **PII Minimization:**

    *   Collect only required profile fields.
    *   Anonymize usernames and mask any optional location data.

*   **Privacy Controls:**

    *   Expose toggles for users to hide or share profile elements.
    *   Document data retention and deletion policies.

## 5. API & Service Security

*   **Firebase Security Rules:**

    *   Enforce row-level and field-level access controls in Firestore and Storage.
    *   Validate data shapes, ownership, and role claims server-side.

*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**

    *   Implement client-side debounce and throttling for chat message sends and review submissions.
    *   Monitor for excessive requests and inform users of limits.

*   **CORS Configuration (Web):**

    *   Restrict allowed origins in Firebase firebases.json and hosting rules.

## 6. Mobile App Security Hygiene

*   **Secure Configuration:**

    *   Disable Expo Dev Client and verbose logging in production builds.
    *   Apply ProGuard (Android) and Bitcode stripping (iOS) to obfuscate code.

*   **Secure Networking:**

    *   Pin certificate/public keys if possible (SSL pinning libraries).
    *   Reject self-signed or expired certificates.

*   **Secure Storage of Cookies (if any):**

    *   Set `Secure` and `SameSite=Strict` for web cookies.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

*   **Environment Separation:**

    *   Use distinct Firebase projects for development, staging, and production.
    *   Prevent development keys from being deployed to production.

*   **Disable Debug Endpoints:**

    *   Remove or secure any diagnostic or verbose logging endpoints before release.

*   **Automated Updates:**

    *   Keep Expo SDK, React Native, and dependencies up to date.

## 8. Dependency Management

*   **Vet Dependencies:**

    *   Only use well-maintained libraries (e.g., `date-fns`, `lodash`, `uuid`).
    *   Lock versions via `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**

    *   Integrate SCA tools (e.g., `npm audit`, GitHub Dependabot) into CI.

*   **Minimize Footprint:**

    *   Remove unused packages; audit bundle size.

## 9. Monitoring & Incident Response

*   **Error Reporting:**

    *   Integrate a crash-reporting tool (e.g., Sentry) with PII redaction.

*   **Alerts & Logs:**

    *   Monitor Firebase usage metrics, rule rejections, and quota thresholds.

*   **Incident Playbook:**

    *   Define procedures for compromised tokens, rule misconfigurations, or data breaches.

By following these guidelines, the LockerRoom Talk client will maintain strong confidentiality, integrity, and availability, complementing secure Firebase backend controls and delivering a trustworthy user experience.

# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the LockerRoom Talk app to protect user data and ensure safe interactions.

## Firebase Security Rules

### Authentication Requirements

- **Email Verification**: Required for creating reviews, comments, and sending messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for all user-generated content
- **User Ownership**: Users can only modify their own data

### Content Validation

#### Text Content Security
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Blocks common injection patterns (`$`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`)
- **XSS Prevention**: Blocks script tags and javascript URLs
- **Profanity Filtering**: Basic profanity detection for inappropriate content
- **Length Validation**: Enforces minimum and maximum content lengths
- **Whitespace Validation**: Ensures content is not just whitespace

#### Input Validation
- **Email Format**: Validates proper email format using regex
- **Phone Numbers**: Validates E.164 format for international phone numbers
- **Usernames**: 3-30 characters, no profanity, no SQL injection patterns

### Rate Limiting

Different actions have different rate limits:
- **Review Creation**: 5 minutes between reviews
- **Message Sending**: 1 second between messages
- **Comment Creation**: 30 seconds between comments
- **Report Creation**: 10 minutes between reports

### Data Access Controls

#### User Profiles (`/users/{userId}`)
- **Read**: Any authenticated user (basic profile info only)
- **Create**: Only the user themselves, with email verification
- **Update**: Only the user themselves, immutable fields protected
- **Delete**: Soft delete only via Cloud Functions

#### Reviews (`/reviews/{reviewId}`)
- **Read**: Public for approved reviews, authors can see their own
- **Create**: Authenticated + verified users only, comprehensive validation
- **Update**: Authors can update limited fields, engagement updates allowed
- **Delete**: Authors or moderators only

#### Chat Messages (`/chatRooms/{roomId}/messages/{messageId}`)
- **Read**: Room participants only
- **Create**: Room participants only, with rate limiting
- **Update**: Message sender only
- **Delete**: Soft delete only

#### Private Data (`/users/{userId}/private/{document}`)
- **Read/Write**: User owner only

### Content Moderation

#### Moderation Status
- New reviews default to `pending` status
- Only `approved` reviews are publicly visible
- Moderators can access all content

#### Reporting System
- Users can report inappropriate content
- Rate limited to prevent abuse
- Reports are only accessible to moderators

### Security Monitoring

#### Audit Logs (`/auditLogs/{logId}`)
- Tracks security-relevant events
- Only accessible to moderators
- Managed by Cloud Functions

#### Security Events (`/securityEvents/{eventId}`)
- Tracks potential security threats
- Only accessible to admins
- Managed by Cloud Functions

#### User Sessions (`/userSessions/{sessionId}`)
- Tracks user login sessions
- Users can view their own sessions
- Managed by system

## Client-Side Security

### Environment Variables
- Firebase configuration stored in environment variables
- Sensitive keys not exposed in client code
- Different configurations for development/production

### Input Sanitization
- Client-side validation before server submission
- HTML encoding for user-generated content
- Image upload validation and processing

### Authentication State
- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage
- Automatic token refresh
- Proper logout and session cleanup

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never expose sensitive keys** in client code
2. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details
5. **Regular security updates** for all dependencies

### For Users
1. **Strong passwords** with multi-factor authentication
2. **Email verification** required for sensitive actions
3. **Report inappropriate content** using built-in reporting
4. **Privacy settings** to control data visibility

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate containment** - disable affected features
2. **Assessment** - determine scope and impact
3. **Notification** - inform affected users if required
4. **Remediation** - fix vulnerabilities and restore service
5. **Post-incident review** - improve security measures

# React Runtime Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Child Rendering Error in app/review/[id].tsx
**Problem**: Objects with keys {city, coordinates, name, state} were being rendered directly as React children in line 494.

**Root Cause**: The `review.location` property can be either a string or an object (with city, coordinates, name, state properties), but the component was trying to render it directly without checking its type.

**Fix**: Modified the rendering logic to handle both string and object location data:
```tsx
// Before (causing error):
{review.location}

// After (safe rendering):
{typeof review.location === 'string' ? review.location : review.location?.city || review.location?.name || 'Unknown location'}
```

### 2. Typography Property Missing from ProfileScreen
**Problem**: ReferenceError when accessing `typography` object in ProfileScreen component.

**Root Cause**: The `typography` variable was referenced but not properly created in the component scope. While `createTypographyStyles` was imported, it wasn't being used to create the typography object.

**Fix**: 
1. Added missing import for `generateMultipleUsernames` function
2. Created typography object in component scope:
```tsx
const typography = createTypographyStyles(colors);
```

## Files Modified

1. `/app/review/[id].tsx` - Fixed location rendering issue
2. `/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Fixed typography reference and added missing import

## Technical Details

### Location Data Handling
The fix handles multiple potential location data structures:
- String locations: "New York, NY"
- Object locations: { city: "New York", state: "NY", name: "Central Park", coordinates: {...} }

### Typography System
The typography system now properly initializes in the ProfileScreen component, ensuring all typography styles (h1, h2, caption, body, etc.) are available for use.

## Testing
- Runtime errors should now be resolved
- App should load without crashing on review detail screens
- Profile screen should render without typography errors
- Location data should display properly regardless of format

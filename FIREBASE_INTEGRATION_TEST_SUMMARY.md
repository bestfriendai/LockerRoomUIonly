## 🏗️ Architecture Verification

### Data Flow Confirmed Working:
```
User Registration → Authentication → Profile Creation (with verification)
     ↓
Chat Room Creation → Participant Management → Message Exchange
     ↓  
Real-time Queries → Participant Counts → UI Display (BUG FIXED!)
```

### Security Layer Confirmed:
```
Unauthenticated → BLOCKED ✅
Authenticated but Unverified → LIMITED ACCESS ✅ 
Authenticated + Verified → FULL ACCESS ✅
```

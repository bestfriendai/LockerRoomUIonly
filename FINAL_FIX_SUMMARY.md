# ✅ LockerRoom Talk - All Issues Fixed

## 🎯 Status: READY TO RUN

All critical issues have been resolved. The app is now ready to run on iOS, Android, and Web.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Firebase Duplicate Declaration Error** ✅
**Problem**: Variable `app` was declared twice causing syntax error
**Solution**: Refactored to use local variables inside function scope
**File**: `utils/firebase.ts`

### 2. **Firebase Auth Hermes Compatibility** ✅
**Problem**: Firebase Auth initialization failing with Hermes JS engine
**Solution**: Simplified initialization without complex persistence
**File**: `utils/firebase.ts`

### 3. **Missing Default Exports Warning** ✅
**Problem**: Routes showing missing default export warnings
**Solution**: Routes already had exports; warnings were side effects of Firebase errors
